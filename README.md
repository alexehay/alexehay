## Hi there 👋 my name is Alex!

Welcome to my README! I've put this together very quickly as I will likely not use GitHub much professionally in the future!

- 📗 Ohio University 28'
- 💻 I have worked with Python, Lua, HTML, and a bit of JavaScript and CSS!
- 🎮 Fun fact: I used to create roblox games from age 10-12!
- 🐓 My dream job would be a career that involves working with birds, planting native trees/plants, or working as a park ranger!
- ✨ I originally wanted to major in CS to work in game dev, but decidied I'd much prefer that as a hobby!
